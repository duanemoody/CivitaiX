# Civitai X
A userscript intended to scratch a few personal itches using Civitai.com:
* With one click, check/uncheck all the items generated by a prompt for more quickly archiving/deleting related images ![1000005181](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/37c6200e-de46-4353-bade-416e7f599f8f)

* CSS tweaks:
  * Model titles now outlined to pop better against lighter preview images ![1000005174](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/89a45c1b-ddea-4568-8dfa-ae8d3eff6e7e)
  * "Early Access" badge given its own background color differentiating it from Update Green ![1000005176](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d5021d3e-0da7-4198-8d45-f7081af2994a)
  * "Save To:" category list height now proportional to viewport, not fixed ![1000005178](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/06421abd-475a-4f57-b13a-b26d9b9b76ca)

## Installation:
First, make sure you have a userscript manager like [Tampermonkey](https://www.tampermonkey.net) or [Violentmonkey](https://violentmonkey.github.io) installed in your browser. Mac Safari users, get the [Userscripts](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/userscripts/id1463298887) app. Ironically, *don't* install Greasemonkey because it disabled the ability to modify styles years ago.
*[Mobile users: Your best bets today are either [Tampermonkey for Android Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/android/addon/tampermonkey) or [Userscripts for iOS Safari](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/userscripts/id1463298887); mobile Chrome is still a holdout.]*

Then, go [here](https://github.com/duanemoody/CivitaiX/raw/refs/heads/main/CivitaiX.user.js) and the userscript should be installed. If you just see Javascript code, go back and check to see you really installed the manager.

## Usage
Most of this is automatic. To check/uncheck all the gens from a single prompt, click the generation count icon at top left of each prompt output.
